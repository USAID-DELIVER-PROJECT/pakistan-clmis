                                        <p>The USAID | DELIVER PROJECT Pakistan has been tasked by the Government of Pakistan with implementing a functioning LogisticsManagement Information System (LMIS) using a web based approach. During enhancement process LMIS was contextualized to local stakeholder structure and devolution. The LMIS was launched by Prime Minister of Pakistan on July 2011 as first Logistics Management Information System of Pakistan.</p>
                                        <p>LMIS has the flexibility to integrate other health commodities in addition to contraceptives. In addition to public sector, application is also able to record contraceptives national sales data of private sector. Currently, the system is able to respond to district level reporting by aggregating facilities level data through paper based reports. The future vision is to enhance the application for facility level reporting on logistics indicators for each district along with district store commodities status. To strengthen reporting and visibility of private sector contraceptives, district level interface will also be incorporated in LMIS applications which will enables provincial and regional health and population departments to see the contribution of private sector in their geographical areas.</p>
                                        <p>For nationwide implementation of LMIS, the Project needed to train the expected users of the system on its uses and functionality. The two day training provides skills and knowledge required to independently enter and upload data into web-based LMIS. Web-based LMIS played a significant role in improving stock monitoring at the district level. The real time monitoring helped eliminate stock-outs at district level.</p>
                                        <p>Timely and accurate data entry and submission of a monthly report at the district level is critical to the functioning of the LMIS. The data collected from the LMIS can then subsequently be used at each level of the supply chain to enhance informed decision making to meet service delivery demands. Utilization of the LMIS will depend heavily on the level of understanding of those trained on its various functionalities.</p>
                                        <p>The below mentioned training material has been developed to train the master trainers and different level users on LMIS</p>

For this course each major unit of learning is referred to as a Session and each section within is referred to as an Activity. This course has 17 different Sessions. Lecturers are highly encouraged to read the Lecturer Preparation section at the beginning of each session well before leading each session. Note that Synthesis Questions are presented at the end of each session. These can be used to ensure students are grasping the key concepts of each session. Unlike the Certificate course this course is competency-based.</p>

                                        <br>
                                        <p>The Province specific Contraceptive Procurement Manual has been developed to provide the Provincial Governments&#39; Population Welfare and Health Departments&#39; procurement personnel with the information and instructions needed to procure contraceptives of good quality on the international market to support the coordinated goals of the Provincial Governments towards improving maternal and child health in their respective provinces. The Contraceptive Procurement Manual incorporates best international procurement practices that help promote transparency, accountability and efficiency in the public sector procurement process.  The Procurement Manual addresses the key phases of the procurement cycle, from procurement planning and issuing invitations to bid, to bid evaluation, supplier selection, contract award and management.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><br>The primary audience for the Contraceptive Procurement Manual is procurement officers and other direct procurement staff who are assigned responsibility for procuring quality contraceptives.   The Procurement Manual provides these personnel with step-by-step instructions for completing standard bidding documents, opening bids from suppliers, evaluating supplier bids and monitoring supplier performance.   The manual also includes supplementary materials, such as information on pre-qualification and pre-shipment compliance programs, which are designed to support procurement officers in effectively implementing public sector procurement of contraceptives.</p>
                                        <p><br>The Contraceptive Procurement Manual also provides pertinent information for policymakers and mid-level decision makers who are not required to understand the detailed procedures of the procurement process, but should understand the overall procurement process for contraceptives and the role they can play to help ensure the procurement process is effectively implemented.  It is recommended that this audience review Appendix IV: Summary Guide for Policymakers, Directors and Managers.
                                            The Contraceptive Procurement Manual also includes key reference documents, such as the Public Procurement Rules 2010 and the Drugs (Labeling and Packing) Rules 1986, to ensure that procurement officers have access to original resource documents as they prepare for and conduct public sector procurement of contraceptives.
                                            Users of the Contraceptive Procurement Manual are encouraged to thoroughly review the Manual in order to fully understand the breadth and scope of the information it contains so that they can be fully prepared to conduct effective public sector procurement of quality contraceptives for the people of their respective provinces.
